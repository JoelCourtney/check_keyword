//! A trait for String-like types to check if a string is a reserved keyword,
//! and convert it to a safe non-keyword if so.
//!
//! Only strict and reserved keywords are checked against; weak keywords are not included.
//!
//! You can add this dependency with:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! check_keyword = "0.2"
//! ```
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use check_keyword::CheckKeyword;
//! let keyword = "match";
//!
//! assert!(keyword.is_keyword());
//! assert_eq!(keyword.into_safe(), "r#match");
//! ```
//! 
//! The [CheckKeyword::into_safe] method automatically checks [CheckKeyword::is_keyword] for you.
//! You don't need to call [CheckKeyword::is_keyword]
//! if you don't care whether it was originally a keyword or not.
//! 
//! # Implementations
//! 
//! There is a special implementation of `CheckKeyword<String>` for [&str], and a
//! blanket implementation of `CheckKeyword<T>` where `T: AsRef<str> + From<String>`.
//! 
//! The blanket implementation covers [String], and is only tested for that, but should
//! cover any other String-like type as well. I can try to broaden the definition to fit
//! other types if needed (open an issue).
//! 
//!
//! # Rust Editions
//!
//! By default, the keywords added in Rust Edition 2018 are included in the list of checked keywords.
//! This can be disabled with `default-features = false` in your Cargo.toml.
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! check_keyword = { version = "0.2", default-features = false }
//! ```
//!
//! Future Rust editions may add new keywords, and this crate will be updated to reflect that.
//! (Or you can create an issue on github if I don't.)
